      <description>Leave your data there, let me send my app over Today&amp;rsquo;s cloud computing cannot handle tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s use cases No matter what kind of computation we need to put input data and algorithm code together into a computer, and run the algorithm against the data so that we can get the result.
In most cases today, we will deploy our code to a cloud provider (Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Alibaba, etc.)&amp;lsquo;s cloud server inside a data center first, then upload the data into the same server, run the code, output the result.</description>

      <title>Ipfs Miners Add Compute Power</title>

      <description>What a wonderful decentralized storage world IPFS (and other similar projects on the decentralized storage market) provides us a new way of thinking on storage. Instead of storing everything in a centralized location, why do not we make multiple copies and distributed to millions of nodes all over the world? The user can get one copy from any of them based on the network distance or bandwidth. This could become the largest CDN system in the world under the economic incentive model to IPFS miners.</description>

      <description>Do not expect dApp is ready today, there are missing pieces TCP/IP was invented around the 1970s, Database 1980, but web app and mobile internet become popular around 2000. It takes about 30 years. Bitcoin was invented in 2009 which is so far the most popular blockchain application, There is no way for us to expect decentralized apps to get popular within 10 years? It will take some time to get all the pieces in the tech stack to get invented.</description>

      <title>VRF Task Management and Consensus</title>

      <description>I listed several principles in my previous post. Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss them one by one.
How blockchain solve this kind of issue? BTC and other Blockchain projects gave us a good example of using randomness. BTC uses the PoW (Proof of Work) consensus to generate the randomness. No one can predict which miner will win the next block in the hash power competition. An attacker has to own more than 51% hash power to attack the BTC network, which means the attack cost is super high.</description>

      <title>Existing Centralized Trust Solution</title>

      <description>Although we generally do not trust a machine in the middle of nowhere, in most cases we still use them, every day, every minute, every second. Cloud computing is one example. Nowadays most of the computing is happening in the data center of cloud computing providers, such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and others. We trust them because they are big names, and we trust them because we know they spend tons of resources to keep our data secure.</description>

      <title>Secure your data at rest, in transmit, and more difficult, in use</title>

      <description>When we talking about secure our data, we actually mean three different stages of a data&amp;rsquo;s life.
Data at rest: When data is sleeping in someone&amp;rsquo;s hard drive. Data in transit: Data is transferred between two trusted domains. eg. from a database server to compute node, or from your browser to a server. Data in use: Data is calculated inside a machine (RAM and CPU) Data in transit problem has been resolved by cryptography, such as https have been widely used.</description>

      <description>I have not written any blog since 2013. Yes, I did write blogs, a long time ago. It was in the year 2005 when my daughter Emma was born. That was also the year my family and I immigrated to Canada. I wrote blogs almost every day about my everyday life as a new immigrant from an eastern country. There are too many things to be written to remember since not everyone has the chance to have the 2nd life - first 35 years living in the eastern world and the rest N (N =?</description>

      <description>IPFS vs traditional web IPFS tell your what to look for, but traffitional web do where to look for.
In traditional web, if the server you access is comprimised, you probably get a modified verison of the content you are looking for. In most cases, the modified version contains trojan or virus.
In IPFS, it won&amp;rsquo;t happen. You can verify the hash.
