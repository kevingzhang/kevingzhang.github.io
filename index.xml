      <description>Do not expect dApp is ready today, there are missing pieces TCP/IP was invented around the 1970s, Database 1980, but web app and mobile internet become popular around 2000. It takes about 30 years. Bitcoin was invented in 2009 which is so far the most popular blockchain application, There is no way for us to expect decentralized apps to get popular within 10 years? It will take some time to get all the pieces in the tech stack to get invented.</description>

      <description>I listed several principles in my previous post. Let&#39;s discuss them one by one.
How blockchain solve this kind of issue? BTC and other Blockchain projects gave us a good example of using randomness. BTC uses the PoW (Proof of Work) consensus to generate the randomness. No one can predict which miner will win the next block in the hash power competition. An attacker has to own more than 51% hash power to attack the BTC network, which means the attack cost is super high.</description>

      <description>Although we generally do not trust a machine in the middle of nowhere, in most cases we still use them, every day, every minute, every second. Cloud computing is one example. Nowadays most of the computing is happening in the data center of cloud computing providers, such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and others. We trust them because they are big names, and we trust them because we know they spend tons of resources to keep our data secure.</description>

      <title>Secure your data at rest, in transmit, and more difficult, in use</title>

      <description>When we talking about secure our data, we actually mean three different stages of a data&#39;s life.
Data at rest: When data is sleeping in someone&#39;s hard drive. Data in transit: Data is transferred between two trusted domains. eg. from a database server to compute node, or from your browser to a server. Data in use: Data is calculated inside a machine (RAM and CPU) Data in transit problem has been resolved by cryptography, such as https have been widely used.</description>

      <description>I have not written any blog since 2013. Yes, I did write blogs, a long time ago. It was in the year 2005 when my daughter Emma was born. That was also the year my family and I immigrated to Canada. I wrote blogs almost every day about my everyday life as a new immigrant from an eastern country. There are too many things to be written to remember since not everyone has the chance to have the 2nd life - first 35 years living in the eastern world and the rest N (N =?</description>
